# Employee Directory - React 

This is an application that demonstrates the display of an employee directory using React and Random User Generator. 

---

#### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

#### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

---

My project stands out by the use of state and apparent memory of your last chosen filter /sort action. The user can manipluate the data in any order they choose and the UI will further filter or sort the data they have infront of them. 

During this project I have learnt how to break up an applicationâ€™s UI into React components and manage component state, responding to user events.

## Improvements

Required: 
* There needs to be a sort feature added to the application. The API data is already sorted by alphabetical order by last name; functionality for the employeer to sort by another field is requiered. 

I would like to add: 
* Mobile Responsiveness.
* Filter by ... select option. 

## Updates 

(20.02.2021)
 - Sort feature added 

![Sort feature screen shot](public/assets/screenShot/shot2.png)

- Sort will remember state of all previous requests. ie, if you filter and then sort by age it will maintain the filter. It will then further remember your filter if you change back to neutral option 'Sort By'. It will even remmeber how you sorted the data if you remove and add a new filter. 

- Reverse Data button added. 
Needs improvement, you can reverse data once per sort or filter but not sequentially.
