# Employee Directory - React 

This is an application that demonstrates the display of an employee directory using React and Random User Generator. 

---

#### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

#### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

During this project I have learnt how to break up an applicationâ€™s UI into React components and manage component state, responding to user events.

## Improvements

Required: 
* There needs to be a sort feature added to the application. The API data is already sorted by alphabetical order by last name; functionality for the employeer to sort by another field is requiered. 

I would like to add: 
* Mobile Responsiveness.
* Filter by ... select option.
